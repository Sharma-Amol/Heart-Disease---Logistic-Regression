# Heart-Disease---Logistic-Regression

## Code
[Heart - LR]()

## Context
The goal of this exercise is to create a Classification Model that can predict whether or not a person has presence of heart disease based on features based on physical testing of that person (age, sex, cholestrol, fasting blood sugar, etc).

This exercise and the associated dataset were provided as part of the excellent course 'Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass' by Jose Portilla on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/), which I successfully completed.

## Dataset
[Heart]()

## Algorithm
Logistic Regression

## Libraries
 * Numpy
 * Pandas
 * Matplotlib
 * Saeborn
 * Scikit-Learn
